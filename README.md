# PixyVision

This was developed for use in the First Robotics Competition by me for FRC 4-H Team 1991.

This collects data sent over serial from an Arduino with an attached PixyCAM (http://www.cmucam.org/projects/cmucam5)
Uses an electron-based application to show the approximate location of detected objects.
